## Some more ideas!

1. Rather than just chat messages, add logic to accept commands from user socket and send back results e.g: typing `/names` to list all of the users in the chatroom

2. Add the ability to send and receive private messages to users e.g. `/msg [username] [msg]` to send a private message to a user

3. Create a web client to connect to your chatroom

4. Support more than 1 chatroom
